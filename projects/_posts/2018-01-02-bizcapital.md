### Situation

###### Ambiente Online de Solicitação de Empréstimo

Empréstimo para pequenas e médias empresas ainda é extremamente burocratizado no Brasil.
Coletar informações e utilizar inteligência artificial para tomar as decisões de crédito visa suprir a demanda por crédito,
garantir adimplência das empresas e escalar o poder tomada de decisão quanto à cessão de empréstimos.

###### Benchmarking

Finding and playing the right music means different things depending on who you are and how you feel.
The right music might mean “dropping the needle” on a specific track on Sunday evening while on Monday morning Bieber might do the trick.
The latter approach requires very little effort but comes at a gamble with your taste buds.
What if we could guarantee a long set of music you love minus the effort?

After leaving Facebook, I wanted to expose myself to a variety of business problems as a contractor.
My first contract opportunity was with Spotify as a lead product designer on a project involving a music intelligence acquisition.
I worked closely with the product manager, Matthew Ogle — defining the product, constraints, and success metrics.
I wrote user research scripts and built relevant prototypes ranging from product packaging to feedback micro-interactions.
I monitored the performance of the product while we ran targeted tests and prioritized features that aligned with our usage intentions up until launch.
I also worked closely and early with the Spotify marketing team in order to name, frame, and release the product.'

### Impact



Increased duration of Spotify listening sessions significantly.

### Challenges



Could we reduce the effort of finding good music?
Could the reduction in effort scale?
How do we package the songs? Genre?
How often do we update the collection?
Should we accept user feedback?
What do we name it?
