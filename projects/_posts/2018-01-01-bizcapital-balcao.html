platform: "Web â€¢ Responsive"

situation: "

The customer acquisition is one of the most important processes inside an online lending company because it intersects Credit Analysis, Data Science, Marketing and User Experience.
<br /><br />
It is a touchpoint that collects crucial information to make the business not only stay on the right track but also thrive in such crowded and regulated market as online lending.
Also, the customer experience provided by commercial banks leaves us too many options to tackle.
<br /><br />
What if we could translate this painful and complicated process into a web product that provides the customer constant feedback and is always being improved to reduce interaction costs so that we can maximize the information collected to nurture all areas of the business while we minimize user effort?
<br /><br />
Our team worked on two iterations of this product. Being the first one treated as an MVP, we could learn where to reduce friction and where to focus on automation. Our second iteration achieved 25% less drop-off than the other in the first month of comparison.
