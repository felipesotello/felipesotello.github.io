situation: "

We weren't in need of an application to provide to our customers since most of the friction was caused by lack of automation and bureaucratization of processes.
<br /><br />
That was until our clients started to show us that they had a very particular need: autonomy. This would reduce not only a lot of friction for the already customers but a lot of internal work as well.
<br /><br />
Through research, we built a list of use cases to serve as the foundation of this product and prioritized a few of them. So, the first iteration of this product made possible to our customers to keep track of their loan status and make payments without having to contact us, which was a real game changer.
