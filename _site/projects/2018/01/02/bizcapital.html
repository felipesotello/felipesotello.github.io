<p>Empréstimo para pequenas e médias empresas ainda é extremamente burocratizado no Brasil.
Coletar informações e utilizar inteligência artificial para tomar as decisões de crédito visa suprir a demanda por crédito,
garantir adimplência das empresas e escalar o poder tomada de decisão quanto à cessão de empréstimos.</p>

<p>Finding and playing the right music means different things depending on who you are and how you feel.
The right music might mean “dropping the needle” on a specific track on Sunday evening while on Monday morning Bieber might do the trick.
The latter approach requires very little effort but comes at a gamble with your taste buds.
What if we could guarantee a long set of music you love minus the effort?</p>

<p>After leaving Facebook, I wanted to expose myself to a variety of business problems as a contractor.
My first contract opportunity was with Spotify as a lead product designer on a project involving a music intelligence acquisition.
I worked closely with the product manager, Matthew Ogle — defining the product, constraints, and success metrics.
I wrote user research scripts and built relevant prototypes ranging from product packaging to feedback micro-interactions.
I monitored the performance of the product while we ran targeted tests and prioritized features that aligned with our usage intentions up until launch.
I also worked closely and early with the Spotify marketing team in order to name, frame, and release the product.’</p>
